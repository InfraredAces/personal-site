Using my experience creating a drop in replacement board for the PXN X9 to provide an example of the process of making one's own custom RP2040 based board and using it with GP2040-CE firmware.

## General PCB Creation Process

This is the general process for creating a PCB to replace an existing board.

    Measure("Measure dimensions of existing PCB")
    EdgeCut("Create Edge Cut")
    TestBoardFit("Have Board Fabricated and Test Fit")

    Measure --> EdgeCut
    EdgeCut --> TestBoardFit
    TestBoardFit -.->|Test Fit Fails| Measure

    CreateSchematic("Create Schematic for Board Components")
    ReviewDesign("Review Schematic Design")
    BoardLayout("Layout components on PCB")
    TestBoard("Have Board Fabricated and Assembled and Test Board")
    BoardCompleted([Board Successfully Created])

    TestBoardFit -.->|Test Fit Succeeds| CreateSchematic
    CreateSchematic --> ReviewDesign
    ReviewDesign --> BoardLayout
    BoardLayout --> TestBoard
    TestBoard -.->|Board Test Fails| ReviewDesign
    TestBoard -.->|Board Test Succeeds| BoardCompleted
